1. What is ECMAScript?
   # ECMAScript is a standardized scripting language specification that provides a foundation for various scripting languages, ensuring common practices and interoperability among them.

   For example, if you want to write a new scripting language, you would follow the ECMAScript standards to maintain consistency in your code.

2. What are ECMAScript Versions?

   ES6:
   - Arrow functions for concise function expressions.
   - Classes for object-oriented programming.
   - Template literals for multi-line strings and string interpolation.
   - Destructuring assignment for unpacking values from arrays and objects.
   - Default parameters for functions.
   - Rest and spread operators for arrays and function arguments.
   - `let` and `const` for block-scoped variable declarations.
   - Promises for handling asynchronous operations.
   - Modules for better code organization and encapsulation.
   - Map and Set data structures.
   - Enhanced object literals.
   - Iterators and generators for custom iteration behavior.

   ES7:
   - `Array.prototype.includes()` method for checking if an array includes a certain value.
   - Exponential operator (`**`) for exponentiation.

   ES8:
   - `async` and `await` for handling asynchronous operations.
   - `Object.entries()` and `Object.values()` methods for retrieving key-value pairs and values from objects.
   - `String.prototype.padStart()` and `String.prototype.padEnd()` for padding strings.
   - `SharedArrayBuffer` and `Atomics` for shared memory and atomic operations.

   ES2019:
   - `Array.prototype.flat()` and `Array.prototype.flatMap()` for array flattening.
   - `Object.fromEntries()` for transforming key-value pairs into objects.
   - Optional catch binding in `try/catch` statements.

   ES2020:
   - Nullish coalescing operator (`??`) for handling null or undefined.
   - Optional chaining operator (`?.`) for safer property access.
   - `BigInt` for handling large integers.
   - `Promise.allSettled()` for handling multiple promises.

   ES2021:
   - `String.prototype.replaceAll()` for replacing all occurrences of a substring.
   - `Promise.any()` for resolving when any promise is fulfilled.
   - `WeakRefs` and `FinalizationRegistry` for memory management.

   ES2022:
   - Class fields and private methods for better encapsulation in classes.
   - Top-level `await` for using `await` at the top level of modules.
   - Ergonomic brand checks for `instanceof`.

   ES2023:
   - New array methods like `.toSorted()`, `.toSpliced()`, and `.fromEntries()`.
   - Improved memory management with `WeakRefs` and `FinalizationRegistry`.
