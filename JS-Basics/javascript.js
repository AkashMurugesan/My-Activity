1. what is javascript?

    # Initially, JavaScript was a scripting language used to add dynamic functionality to web browser.Later, it evolved into an interpreted and partially compiled language, now JavaScript runtime environments make javascript independent.
    
    REF:
    # Scripting language: JavaScript was primarily used for client-side scripting.
    # Interpreted and compiled: JavaScript is still mainly interpreted, but modern JavaScript engines (like V8) use techniques like Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation to optimize performance.
    # JavaScript runtime environment: Environments like Node.js allow JavaScript to be used outside the browser, extending its capabilities.


2. Engines of javascripts

    # V8: Google’s engine used in Chrome and Node.js, with JIT compilation.
    # SpiderMonkey: Mozilla’s engine in Firefox, supporting JIT and garbage collection.
    # JavaScriptCore (Nitro): Apple’s engine in Safari, known for speed and optimization.
    # Chakra: Microsoft’s engine in legacy Edge and Internet Explorer, with ChakraCore as the open-source version.
    # Hermes: Facebook’s engine for React Native, optimized for mobile performance and low memory usage.
